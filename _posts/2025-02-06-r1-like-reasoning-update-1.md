Today was mostly about **organizing results**, evaluating **new checkpoints**, and making sense of all the numbers. We also kicked off a fresh experiment to **test the impact of data quality on reasoning in small LLMs**—but more on that later.

**Granite \+ Particle Filtering \= Big Gains 📈**

We already knew from our earlier experiments that **particle filtering works well** across multiple small models. But as we were compiling today’s results, we found something even more exciting: **Granite models also benefit significantly from our method\!** 🎉

Here’s how Granite 8B performed on the key benchmarks:

✅ **MATH-500:** **0.78** (Granite 8B)

✅ **AIME 2024:** **16.6** (Granite 8B)

This is **huge**—our **particle filtering method actually makes Granite better than GPT-4o on Math-500 and AIME 2024\!** 🎉🎉

**More Cool Results 🔥**

Across the board, **introducing reasoning**—using all the methods we talked about earlier—led to **consistent performance gains** on the **Math-500 and AIME 2024** benchmarks. Here’s a giant results table summarizing where we stand **(adding it here soon 👀)**.

**Data Quality: A Game-Changer?**

We came across this fascinating paper today: 🔗 [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387), which dives deep into the importance of **data quality** in reasoning. The results are wild—they trained a **Qwen-32B** model on just **\~800 high-quality reasoning samples** and got **O1/R1-level performance** on MATH-500 and AIME24\!

Naturally, we had to try it out ourselves. **And guess what? It worked\!** Applying the same strategy to **Phi-4** gave us Phi-LIMO which is the best performing model so far (investigating the evaluation script as the numbers on the second run turned out to be lower), ~~which is **on par with the R1-distilled Llama-8B model**~~ 

**Most Interesting Takeaway of the Day**

Our **synthetic data-based reasoning methods** actually resulted in a **Phi-4 model that reasons better than vanilla Phi-4**—*and* it **shows its reasoning** in the process. That’s a big win for using synthetic data to enhance reasoning capabilities.

**What’s Still Running?**

Most of our compute is tied up with existing runs, so today we’re launching just **two more experiments**:

🔹 **Testing the LIMO dataset on Granite** – Can a really small model **develop reasoning** with just **\~800 high-quality examples**? We’ll let you know tomorrow.

🔹 **Generating synthetic data using particle filtering** on LIMO dataset questions—will this further enhance reasoning abilities?

This is funny so I have to mention it, GPT4-o just told me the following:   
**Did you know?** The human brain makes **approx. 35,000 decisions per day**, many of them involving subconscious “particle filtering” to evaluate possible outcomes. Teaching LLMs to backtrack and refine their reasoning is, in a way, mimicking our own decision-making process. 

What? 🤯
